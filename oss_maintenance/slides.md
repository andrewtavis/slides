# Benefits

Tangible benefits of OSS maintenance

- Working on larger ideas that are too much for just yourself
- Practicing product and engineering management
- The enjoyment of meeting, collaborating with and learning from others
- Giving back to OSS and helping others in their journeys
  - Practicing sponsorship for early stage devs and those in need

# Drawbacks

What to watch out for

- Very long hours outside of work depending on the project
- Strain on relationships (be clear with those around you and practice no)
- Have plans of what you want to achieve and for all else sponsor

# Basics

Files that all projects should have

- A nice name AND some kind of logo (can just be the name in a font)
- Readme: For many developers it's the only thing they'll look at, so don't worry about it being verbose
  - Include shields/badges, images and or videos of the project, icons for platforms the community uses
- Contributing: Everything that's in the readme and that would make the readme too verbose
- Code of Conduct: Contributor Covenant as a baseline
  - `COC_CONTACT.md` as Contributor Covenant hard codes an email that people might copy
- License
- Community chats: Matrix, GitHub Discussions, Discord

# Communication

- Maintainer checklist with invitation to community spaces in PRs
- Always thank people for their contributions and tie in what they're helping with
- Apologize if it took you a while to respond or react, or send a quick message that they can export to wait
- Sandwich responses by noting the good before getting into things that need improvement
  - Consider not "requesting changes" as this can come across as harsh (just comment)
  - Discuss conditions of closing a PR without merging with your community
- Provide rights to projects
  - Triage as an initial thank you for dedication
  - Organization role with continued interest
