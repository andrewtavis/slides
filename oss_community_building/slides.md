# Preparing your project (1)

## Tools

- Codebase: [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- Office: \[insert email/calendar app\] ([Proton](https://proton.me/))
- Communication: [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) or [Zulip](https://zulip.com/)
  - Bring your account vs. no account required for public rooms
  - People are confused by Matrix federation
  - Suggest [Element](https://element.io/) or another client in your documentation

## Other teams

- Localization: [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/)
- Design: [Open Source Design](https://opensourcedesign.net/)

# Preparing your project (2)

## Initial documentation

> Borrow liberally from other open-source projects

- Readme: Project description, everything to start developing, logo at the top
  - Logos: A PNG banner with the project name over a color is more inviting than just text
- License: For both the code and the content (and license headers for files)
- Contributing guide: More advanced setup, all testing procedures, learning resources, etc
- Code of Conduct: [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) or similar

## Added later

- Other files: Style guide, security file, privacy policy, 3rd party software notice, localization guide, etc
- Contribution checks: Code linting, formatting checks, testing and code coverage reports

<div id="progress" class="w-4/12"/>

# Finding contributors

> ... besides social media

## Issue aggregators

- Issues and projects searchable on websites (sometimes sent via email)
- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/), [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/), [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
  - Label issues `good-first-issue` and/or `help-wanted`
- Seasonal contribution events like [Hacktoberfest üéÉ](https://hacktoberfest.com/) and [24 Pull Requests üéÅ](https://24pullrequests.com/)

## Internships

> Advertise internship participation in your documentation!

- [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) ([Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/))
- [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
- [Linux Foundation Mentorship Program (LFX)](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/)

<div id="progress" class="w-5/12"/>

# Who you'll find

> Either of the following groups can contribute long term

> Schedule calls motivated contributors to onboard, explain the project and pair code ‚òéÔ∏è

## Students

- Many students need to contribute to open-source for classes
- Positive interactions with one student can lead to others from the same school joining
- If they are working on a school project, always ask them what the deadline is

## Professionals

- Often times switching careers or in-between jobs
- Ask experienced professionals to critique the project and write issues

<div id="progress" class="w-6/12"/>

---

# Supporting your community

> The following is not required, but will help build and keep people in the community

## Students

- Mentorship and working towards internships (Outreachy, GSoC, LFX)
  - They need to earn the internship over new applicants (can review other contributions)

## All community members

- Check that their Git email matches their account to make sure they get contributions
- CV, resume and application checks
- Job recommendations and connecting them to your network
- Let their interests drive their contributions (especially if you're not paying them)
- Promote them via repository triage rights, organization membership, write access (**\*2FA**), etc
- Share ownership (of part of the code, of a project, of the organization)

<div id="progress" class="w-7/12"/>

# Rituals

## Dev syncs üßë‚Äçüíª‚ôªÔ∏è

- Every two weeks on a Saturday (~15:00/16:00 UTC)
- Regular office hours for support, pair coding and people meeting one another
- Take notes in an Etherpad or other open-source notes app
- Send recap to the development channel so people who aren't there can stay caught up

## Others

- Bi-monthly Code Nights üåô, Code Brunches üçû‚òï, whatever your community comes up with
  - In-person, hybrid and remote are all possible
  - Generally attended by core contributors and those wanting to contribute more
- Deployment calls üöÄ
  - Great opportunity to celebrate and teach community members

# Ritual automation

- There's a lot of work involved in keeping to your rituals, so try to automate what you can
- [Dev sync reminder message](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/.github/workflows/matrix_dev_sync_reminder.yml)
  - Sent each Wednesday before a dev sync
  - Fully explain it as this is more for new people (others have calendar invites)
  - Time and date in UTC with a [ZoneStamp](https://zonestamp.toolforge.org/)
  - Have it create the notes pad and add links to anything else a new person needs
- [Community Spotlight message üë•üéâ](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/.github/workflows/community_spotlight_message.yml)
  - At the end of every month run a workflow to calculate the top contributors for the period
  - Send a thank you message to the development channel with links to accounts and contributions
  - Filter out organization members so the focus is on people new to the community
  - Use this as a reminder to share things about your contributors on social media

<div id="progress" class="w-10/12"/>

# Important points

## Self care

- Going above and beyond with community support builds comradery that will extend beyond yourself
- With the above in mind, please watch out for burnout
  - Take care of yourself, have a life, set boundaries and respect when people need to step away

## Community

- Include the community wherever possible by saying "we" instead of "I"
- Keep your communication positive! (and be mindful of cultural interpretations)
- Prompt communication when you assign an issue and thank them for opening PRs/MRs
- Discuss with community how hard it should be to contribute (tests, `pre-commit`, when to close a PR/MR)
- Try to bring in contributions, check in if there's been no activity and say "Hope all's well!"
- Don't "lgtm": Contextualize the contribution, thank them and say you're looking forward to the next time!
- Enjoy the friendships you'll make ‚ù§Ô∏è
