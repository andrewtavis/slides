# What is open-source software?

- The word "source" in this case means "source code" that is open for anyone to see

- Can be any kind of application you can think of!
  - Email apps, web browsers, games, software used in varied industries, etc

- Not only can anyone see it, but people can also get their own version of it (fork the code)

- Those who have their own versions can then share changes with one another (contributions)

- Through this way many people can work on a project together collaboratively

- It's normal that developers store their code on platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
  - These include chat threads, organization boards and other features to help us work together

<br/>

> Note: Closed-source code can also be shared, but with open source anyone can contribute.

# Software is open by default

- All coding languages like Python, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc are open source

- All web frameworks like Vue, Django, Node, Svelte, Laravel, React, etc are open source

- Most of the tools that we use around these languages and frameworks are open source

- This means that most websites and mobile apps are predominantly written with open source software

- The world runs on open source! Even things like `http` are open source (see [httpd](https://downloads.apache.org/httpd/)).

<br/>

# Open source is a movement

- Meetings and major conferences around the world every year to support (F)OSS
  - (F)OSS = (Free) Open Source Software (with a permissive license)

- The goal is to have has much software as possible be open for all to see and use

<div id="progress" class="w-4/11"/>

---

# Join the movement

### Support open software

- OSS is more likely to respect people's privacy and personal information (and be more secure!)

- The communities that create and use open software have more power over the project's development

- There is always a need for new people to join and help create new projects or maintain old ones

<br/>

### Learn and demonstrate skills

- Practice development, UI/UX design, project management and many other valuable skills

- Get practical experience if you're a student, which will really help you in interviews for a first job

- Having a strong open-source presence is very beneficial for the job market
  - Link your [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) profile prominently on your CV as hiring managers do look for them

<div id="progress" class="w-5/11"/>

---

# Finding projects

### Developer platforms

- Make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) and/or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)

- You can then search for projects based on coding language, device, topics that interest you, etc

- Check the status of the project and look into if it's welcoming to new contributors

- Larger projects are harder to get into, but the community might have smaller ones you can join

<br/>

### Issue aggregators

- Issues and projects searchable on websites (sometimes sent via email)

- Examples: [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/), [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/), [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)

- Seasonal contribution events like [Hacktoberfest üéÉ](https://hacktoberfest.com/) and [24 Pull Requests üéÅ](https://24pullrequests.com/)

# Internships

- An open-source internship is very valuable experience at the start of a career as a software developer

- The most reputable internships are:
  - [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) ([Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/))
  - [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
  - [Linux Foundation Mentorship Program (LFX)](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/)

- All of the above internships are paid over a period of a few months

- The best way to get an open-source internship is to already be involved in open source!
  - Find a community that participates in these internships and work on some good first issues with them
  - Get to know the team members and communicate your interest in doing an internship
  - You'll have to earn the internship over other applicants, but you'll have a head start with the code
  - Tip: Collaborate with other interns and try to help review other contributions along with your work

<div id="progress" class="w-7/11"/>

# First steps

> You've found a project you want to contribute to! Now what?

- Start by reading the documentation of the project
  - The website, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (all instructions you'll need to contribute)

- Join the chat rooms for the community and introduce yourself if you're comfortable doing so

- Look for issues that are labeled `good-first-issue` and/or `help-wanted` that interest you

- Write into an unassigned issue and ask the person who made it or a maintainer if you could help
  - It might take a few hours or days for them to reply based on how active the project is

- If someone is already assigned, you can ask to collaborate with them

- Check the rituals of the community and if it's ok for you to join (regular calls)

<div id="progress" class="w-8/11"/>

---

# Positive behavior

- Communicate your goals and any deadlines you have to get the work done (school project due date)
  - Let maintainers know if you're experiencing problems and ask for help (they want you to succeed)

- After a few contributions, start looking into whether you can support with code reviews
  - Reviewing code from other community members is very helpful for projects

- Ask maintainers for suggestions on how you can improve your contributions

<br/>

# Negative behavior

- Don't just use AI/ML to generate a solution (these are tools to help YOU write the code)

- Don't ask for rights to the code (this is very sensitive - they're given, not asked for)

<div id="progress" class="w-9/11"/>

# What it's like to work in open source

- You'll meet people from all over the world!

- You'll make friends and form connections that can help you in your career
  - With consistent effort maybe you can get a job in open-source one day
  - (F)OSS employers are usually more respectful of workers than traditional employers

- It's very rewarding to see your projects grow and to take on bigger roles in their communities
  - It can be very exhausting, so take care of yourself and watch out for burnout
  - Prioritize school, work, relationships and friendships

- It's empowering to be a part of a movement that makes such a positive impact in the world
  - Remember to support others with their open-source journeys! ‚ù§Ô∏è
